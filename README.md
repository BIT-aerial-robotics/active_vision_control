## üîç About

This project provides MATLAB implementations of the active vision control system proposed in the paper, designed for real-time object detection on UAVs using multi-modal sensors (LiDAR and camera). The method addresses challenges related to limited field of view (FoV) sensors and enhances autonomous UAV perception via active control strategies.

The system fuses LiDAR and camera data to optimize viewpoint selection for more efficient and accurate object detection.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Much more detailed instructions and documentation will be added soon. Stay tuned!
